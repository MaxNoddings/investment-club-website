# <u>Saint Michael's College Student Investment Fund Website</u>

This is a website that I am creating for the newly established Student Investment Club at my school (Saint Michael's College)! I am very interested in finance
and how the stock market works, a lot of my friends are involved in the investment club, so building a website for the club has been a great way to get involved.

I am building the website soely in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and plan to host it using Netlify.
